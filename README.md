# ü§ù Ubeswap Contributor Management

This is a project for the Ubeswap hackaton, it is a dapp that lets a DAO distribute grants to contributors. The Dao can approve, cancel the payment or get the funds back if milestones are not met. The [Ubeswap DAO Contributor Agreement](https://docs.google.com/document/d/101BINrXZhpJU148X-zO9kl7JDqHHZqBmddjm9ByohxQ/edit?usp=sharing) is stored in IPFS and its CID is stored in the smart contract.

There are two smart contracts in this dapp: `Factory.sol` and `ContributorContract.sol`. The basic flow would be as follow:

1. Through the front end, the DAO will interact with the `Factory` contract to create different instances of a `ContributorContract`.
2. The front end will display a list with all the `ContributorContract`s created.
3. After the deadline the DAO can approve, disapprove, or get the funds back from the `ContributorContract`.
4. If the `ContributorContract` gets approved by the DAO, the contributor can claim the reward.

Note: The negotiation of the reward needs to happen off-chain maybe in discord or telegram

# Live demo

- I deployed to goerli testnet. You can interact with the dapp at this link: [befitting-fuel.surge.sh](https://befitting-fuel.surge.sh/)
- Also, here is a demo video on [youtube](https://youtu.be/j6-fFVDvfTc).
- The contracts are verified at this addresses:
  - Factory: [0xA5611094f163e4FfBf8b46a29ae687092E9AC087](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0xA5611094f163e4FfBf8b46a29ae687092E9AC087#code)
  - ContributorContract: [0xf6dD5E4F344A9fb9A28483621559f3944B5Db1CA](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0xf6dD5E4F344A9fb9A28483621559f3944B5Db1CA#code)

# Directory Structure

Scaffold-Eth provides a lot of nice functionality that I did not use for this project. The folders that contain all the app functionaliy are:

- `packages/react-app`: contains all the front end in react.
- `packages/hardhat`: contains the solidity contracts and deploy scripts.

Regarding the front end, the important components are located at:

- `packages/react-app/src/views/ContractList`: this componenet displays the contracts created by the DAO.
- `packages/react-app/src/views/components/FactoryEvents`: this is a component that I modified slightly from the `Events` component provided by Scaffold-Eth.
- `packages/react-app/src/views/Home`: it shows the interface to the DAO agent to create more contracts.
- `packages/react-app/src/views/ContractView`: it displays the info of each created contract like deadline, contributor address, reward, etc.

# Run the project locally

One of the nice things of Scaffold-Eth is that is very easy to run a project locally, as prerequisites you will need [Node (v16 LTS)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) plus [Yarn (v1.x)](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

> clone/fork:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wildanvin/contributor-contract
```

> install and start your üë∑‚Äç Hardhat chain:

```bash
cd contributor-contract
yarn install
yarn chain
```

> in a second terminal window, start your üì± frontend:

```bash
cd contributor-contract
yarn start
```

> in a third terminal window, üõ∞ deploy your contract:

```bash
cd contributor-contract
yarn deploy
```

üì± Open http://localhost:3000 to see the app

## IPFS

To upload the document to IPFS I followed this [tutorial](https://dev.to/edge-and-node/uploading-files-to-ipfs-from-a-web-application-50a). You will need to create an IPFS project in [Infura](https://www.infura.io/) and create a `.env` file inside `packages/react-app` like this one:

```bash
REACT_APP_IPFS_PROJECT_ID="<your-infura-project-id>"
REACT_APP_IPFS_PROJECT_SECRET="<your-infura-project-secret>"
```

# Deploy the project to a testnet

To deploy the project to goerli testnet I used the steps provided in [SpeedrunEthereum](https://speedrunethereum.com/challenge/simple-nft-example), starting from Checkpoint 3.

It is important to mention that after you have deployed your contracts to the testnet and published your front end to surge you should go back to the default values that you had when you were working locally.

# For the future:

- Improve the front end.
- Sign a message or the document with metamask or any other wallet.
- Write tests for the smart contracts.
- Run tools like slither, echidna and manticore in order to detect bugs in the contracts.
- Deploy a subgraph so it is easier to search the contracts created by task, contributor, deadline, etc.
- The possibility to add more than one task in each smart contract
